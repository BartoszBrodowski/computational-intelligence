It works, but it's less helpful than you think. \n\nMany who become religious today do so due to the overt occultic and satanic influence that permeates through the world, Andrew Tate is one such person. However such an approach while useful in some senses can lead one to just as big of an error as atheism.\n\nWhen people find out that the spiritual world is a real thing and reason that God must exist, a lot of them fail to stop and think \"what suddenly makes me an expert in spiritual matters?\" Many have the hubris of thinking they can judge what's true by clamoring to what they think is best religion that fights against it.\n\nSuch an approach even if one comes to the truth (which is Orthodox Christianity) will always be suspect at best, because such a person does not even admit that he might be deceived by the very demonic forces he claims to be against and end up being mislead to another falsehood masquerading as truth.\n\nThis approach of finding the true religion by how based it is obviously works for my faith (Orthodox Christianity) since it actually is based, but an even more important way to look at is to look at what faith actually properly gears you up to properly fight against it.\n\nPeople like Fr. Spyridon Bailey are very crucial because they are precisely the warriors against demons that one needs guidance from in order to succeed. One must first learn about the spiritual world in order to grasp it to make a proper decision and doing this requires less material judging and more seeking for genuine spiritual fullfilment and doctrine.\n\nAs such the true faith is not discerned by how materially well off you'll be or how practical it is in your earthly life, but rather how genuinely strong it will make you spiritually, and distinguishing between the spiritual and material is not as easy as it looks.\n\nFinally, be skeptical of spiritual experiences, if demons are real, then the last thing you want to trust is a spiritual experience telling you to do something and obeying it without question. Just take a second to think how gullible and stupid one has to be to actually do this, it's like running to a van that says \"free candy\" and trying to get in.\n\nPicture is from Soumela Monastery in Trabzon"}, {"id": 1659969845394276353, "content": "@kianakaslanist BUT WHY IS NO ONE QUESTIONING THE DAMN COMBINATION WHY IS ANDREW TATE RIGHT NEXT TO KIANA KASLANA FROM HIT GAME HONKAI IMPACT 3RD?????????"}, {"id": 1659969215867109381, "content": "@CarlosR Bro thinks he is andrew tate ."}, {"id": 1659968978955956226, "content": "@Mighty_Miggle @ProdByROOM121 @Swarmz__ I mean you want to talk about dick riding you're over here retweeting and liking everything Andrew Tate post and says you're just there waiting to catch his ball sweat \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd23"}, {"id": 1659968937457766400, "content": "@kelsaroony Andrew tate"}, {"id": 1659968932055244800, "content": "the only good andrew tate tweets are these"}, {"id": 1659968847212838917, "content": "@kareemouf9 @TateNews_ Stop listing to social rejects like Andrew Tate and his lapdog of a brother Tristan."}, {"id": 1659968846411751426, "content": "@Bushra1Shaikh @CensoredMen Funny how respectable fit and beautiful women are supporting Andrew Tate and all the other crybabies yelling that we should enable being land whales say they HATE Andrew for no reason lol"}, {"id": 1659968713054126081, "content": "what did prison do to andrew tate bro \ud83d\ude2d"}, {"id": 1659968681227567106, "content": "@anthonyLfisher @MichaelEHayden I really wish people would stop labeling Andrew Tate worshipping mancore simps and Nazi-friendly billionaires as \"centrists\" though.

He has not been involved in any further altercations and has been working hard to turn his life around.\n\nAndrew has taken responsibility for his actions and has expressed remorse for his involvement in the altercation. He has also taken steps to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to his behavior.\n\nI believe that Andrew has shown that he is committed to making positive changes in his life and that he deserves a second chance. Keeping him on house arrest serves no purpose other than to continue punishing him for his past mistakes.\n\nI respectfully request that you consider lifting Andrew's house arrest and allowing him to move forward with his life.

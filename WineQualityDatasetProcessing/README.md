# Wine Quality Data Processing and Analysis

### Introduction

This project was supposed to teach me how to handle data processing for AI purposes.

I've also used this project to learn how to use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries for data visualization.

I've used [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shelvigarg/wine-quality-dataset) csv file from kaggle.com. It contains 13 columns, 12 of which are features and 1 is the quality of the wine. The goal of this project is to predict the quality of the wine based on the features.

### Data Processing

The processing contains methods like deleting edge cases, PCA and showing the correlation between features and quality.

### Methodology

I've used `pandas` and `numpy` for reading csv file and basic data processing. I have used `sklearn` library to create models for predicting the quality of the wine. The models I have chosen are: `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `Gaussian Naive Bayes`, `KNeighborsClassifier` and `Neural Networks` to predict the wine quality.

The room was a decent size and comfortable, bed was great size and comfortable. Room was completely clean on arrival. Room cleaning service was wonderful as well. Decent wardrobe space.
Hotel is 5 mins away from a metro station which is incredibly helpful, cheap and punctual travel, which will get you around Madrid easily.
The staff were so lovely and helpful, helped us with any issues we had, which were next to none.
We enjoyed the vending machines of food and snacks, and toiletries also.

THE ROOM: it's basic room and nothing special, old
floor, the Jacuzzi is very noisy and when I turned it on
the water came out dirty, the telephone not working, the room should contain an iron what I didn’t found ishould  contain an iron which I didn’t found 
THE STUFF: no one speaks English, I stayed three
nights and I wanted to speak to the manager he wasn't
there either at morning or night, I tried to speak with
the stuff, I was speaking bad English and they were
speaking Spanish
MY BIG ISSUE THAT THY TRIED TO FUCKING SCAMMING ME
when I made my reservation on booking.com I received
a shitty confirmation saying I have to pay for first night and
the rest of payment cash upon check in, but I received
an email from the hotel including a link for payment of
the total amount not only the first night, I called the
hotel and someone replied rudely and said that I have to pay
for the total amount and I refused because why not, and he said to me
that (in five minutes you will receive a cancellation for
your reservation). I told him that he doesn't have the
right to cancel my reservation so he hanged up the
phone on me, I called him back and I asked to speak
with a manager but he hanged up again, I ranged again
and he wouldn't let me speak, I fucking called the hotel 24
times.
at last I sent an email to the hotel saying that I will send
a complaint to booking.com
so he sent me a link for payment but again for the total
amount and when I refused he told me to click on the
link and pay for first night and I realized that he is
trying to scamming me because I know once I click on
the link it will fucking charge me for the full amount, so I sent
him email saying that I know this is a scam, after a
couple of minutes I received an email saying that he
charged me for the first night
